Real Estate Price Prediction
🚀 End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts house price per unit area using real estate features such as MRT distance, nearby amenities, and geographic location.
The model is deployed using a modern Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions.
